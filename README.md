# MySQL-northwind
Data Analysis and Manipulation using MySQL Workbench and online database

In this project, I executed a number of questions for an online database called northwind, which includes data on the delivery and ordering of products to and from customers.

I also added a screenshot of the database schema so that both relations among the tables and data types per table will be known.

The database includes 11 tables. 

For my analysis, I used MySQL Workbench.

The database, the data and the questions to be answered based on the data, are taken from the following site: https://www.sql-practice.com/.
